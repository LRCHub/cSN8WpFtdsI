[00:00.36] Poor me, pour me another drink
[00:05.59] 'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
[00:07.52] No more, hell nah
[00:09.49] I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
[00:13.18] Poor me, pour me another round
[00:18.26] Line 'em up and knock 'em down
[00:20.53] Two more let's go
[00:22.33] 'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before
[00:43.33] 
[00:26.14] Don't wanna think about her
[00:27.27] Or wear a ring without her
[00:29.35] Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
[00:30.69] Can't sing without her
[00:32.49] So make them drinks strong
[00:33.83] 'Cause brother she's gone
[00:35.66] And if I'm ever gonna move on
[00:50.16] 
[00:38.31] I'ma need some whiskey glasses
[00:41.67] 'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
[00:45.38] She's probably making out on the couch right now
[00:48.71] With someone new
[00:51.17] Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
[00:54.50] If I'm gonna make it through
[00:58.35] If I'ma be single
[00:59.64] I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
[01:03.65] And see the world through whiskey glasses
[01:07.27] (Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
[01:09.67] And see the world through whiskey glasses
[01:13.04] (I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)
[01:38.04] 
[01:16.97] Last call
[01:19.07] I swear this will be my last call
[01:22.38] Now I ain't drunk dialling no more at 3 am
[01:26.03] "Mr bartender hittin' me again"
[01:41.53] 
[01:30.33] Don't wanna think about her
[01:32.08] Or wear a ring without her
